# Artemis
Python service developed following a simple architecture. Centered around the concept of events, provides a REST layer to perform CRUD operations on them.

This is a simple rewrite of the very same Go [service](https://github.com/nanchano/bastet), with the intention of keeping it simpler and to provide a Python & ORM example. 

To test the server: `make test-all`

To test the code: `make test`
